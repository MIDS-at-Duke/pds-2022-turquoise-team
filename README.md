For this project, we are trying to address the problem of rising opioid usage and its connection with death by drugs in the United States. We have two specific questions: What effect did the opioid policies in Texas, Washington, and Florida have on the number of opioid deaths and overall drug deaths in those states? In other words, how do opioid deaths and overall drug deaths differ in Texas, Washington, and Florida from our chosen control states?

Using pre-post difference-in-difference analysis, we created two final reports, one for data scientists and one for policy makers.
